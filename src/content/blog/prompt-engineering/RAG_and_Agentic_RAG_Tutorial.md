## What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a powerful AI technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating relevant information from external knowledge sources.

### The Problem RAG Solves
- **LLMs have limited knowledge** - They only know what they were trained on
- **Knowledge cutoff** - Training data has a specific date, missing recent information
- **Hallucination** - LLMs can generate plausible but incorrect information
- **Lack of grounding** - Responses aren't based on specific, verifiable sources

### How RAG Works
RAG combines two main components:
1. **Retrieval** - Find relevant information from a knowledge base
2. **Generation** - Use that information to generate accurate responses

## Traditional RAG Pipeline

### Step-by-Step Process

    A[User Query] --> B[Convert Query to Vector]
    B --> C[Search Vector Database]
    C --> D[Retrieve Similar Chunks]
    D --> E[Combine Retrieved Context]
    E --> F[Create Prompt with Context]
    F --> G[Send to LLM]
    G --> H[Generate Response]
    H --> I[Return Answer to User]
    
    J[Documents] --> K[Convert to Text]
    K --> L[Split into Chunks]
    L --> M[Create Vector Embeddings]
    M --> N[Store in Vector Database]
    N --> C

```

1. **Document Processing**
   - Convert documents to text
   - Split into chunks
   - Create vector embeddings
   - Store in vector database

2. **Query Processing**
   - User asks a question
   - Convert query to vector embedding
   - Search for similar chunks in database

3. **Response Generation**
   - Combine retrieved context with user query
   - Send to LLM for response generation
   - Return answer to user

### Example Implementation
```python
# Simplified RAG pipeline
def simple_rag(query, retriever, llm):
    # 1. Retrieve relevant documents
    docs = retriever.invoke(query)
    
    # 2. Combine context
    context = "\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])
    prompt = f"Context: {context}\n\nQuestion: {query}\nAnswer:"
    
    # 3. Generate response
    response = llm.invoke(prompt)
    return response
```

## Limitations of Traditional RAG

### 1. **Single-Pass Processing**
- Only calls LLM once for response generation
- No verification or refinement
- Limited decision-making capabilities

### 2. **Context Overload**
- All retrieved information sent to LLM at once
- No intelligent filtering or prioritization
- Can lead to irrelevant information inclusion

### 3. **No Quality Control**
- No fact-checking against source documents
- No verification of response accuracy
- Prone to hallucinations and unsupported claims

### 4. **Limited Adaptability**
- Fixed retrieval strategy
- No dynamic query processing
- Cannot handle complex, multi-step queries

### 5. **Poor Error Handling**
- No fallback mechanisms
- Limited debugging capabilities
- Difficult to trace where errors occur

## What is Agentic RAG?

**Agentic RAG** extends traditional RAG by using LLMs as intelligent agents that can make decisions, use tools, and collaborate to solve complex tasks.

### Key Differences from Traditional RAG

| Traditional RAG | Agentic RAG |
|----------------|-------------|
| Single LLM call | Multiple specialized agents |
| Fixed pipeline | Dynamic workflow |
| No verification | Built-in fact-checking |
| Limited reasoning | Multi-step reasoning |
| Static retrieval | Adaptive retrieval |

### Core Principles

1. **Agent Specialization** - Each agent has a specific role
2. **Collaborative Workflow** - Agents work together to solve problems
3. **Dynamic Decision Making** - Agents can adapt based on context
4. **Quality Assurance** - Built-in verification and correction mechanisms

## Multi-Agent RAG Architecture

### Agent Types and Roles

#### 1. **Relevance Checker Agent**
- **Purpose**: Determines if a query can be answered with available documents
- **Output**: CAN_ANSWER, PARTIAL, or NO_MATCH
- **Benefits**: Prevents hallucination by identifying out-of-scope queries

```python
class RelevanceChecker:
    def check(self, question: str, retriever) -> str:
        # Retrieve top documents
        top_docs = retriever.invoke(question)
        
        # Analyze relevance
        prompt = f"""
        Analyze if the documents can answer: {question}
        Respond with: CAN_ANSWER, PARTIAL, or NO_MATCH
        """
        
        return self.llm.invoke(prompt)
```

#### 2. **Research Agent**
- **Purpose**: Generates initial answers based on retrieved documents
- **Process**: Analyzes context and creates draft response
- **Focus**: Factual accuracy and completeness

```python
class ResearchAgent:
    def research(self, question: str, documents: List[Document]) -> Dict:
        # Combine document content
        context = "\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in documents])
        
        # Generate answer
        prompt = f"""
        Answer this question using only the provided context:
        Question: {question}
        Context: {context}
        """
        
        draft_answer = self.llm.invoke(prompt)
        return {"draft_answer": draft_answer, "context_used": context}
```

#### 3. **Verification Agent**
- **Purpose**: Fact-checks generated answers against source documents
- **Process**: Cross-references claims with original sources
- **Output**: Verification report with supported/unsupported claims

```python
class VerificationAgent:
    def verify(self, answer: str, documents: List[Document]) -> Dict:
        context = "\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in documents])
        
        prompt = f"""
        Verify this answer against the context:
        Answer: {answer}
        Context: {context}
        
        Check for:
        - Direct/indirect factual support (YES/NO)
        - Unsupported claims
        - Contradictions
        - Relevance to question
        """
        
        verification = self.llm.invoke(prompt)
        return self.parse_verification(verification)
```

### Workflow Orchestration with LangGraph

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

class AgentWorkflow:
    def _build_workflow(self):
        workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
        
        # Add agent nodes
        workflow.add_node("check_relevance", self._check_relevance_step)
        workflow.add_node("research", self._research_step)
        workflow.add_node("verify", self._verification_step)
        
        # Define flow
        workflow.set_entry_point("check_relevance")
        
        workflow.add_conditional_edges(
            "check_relevance",
            self._decide_after_relevance_check,
            {"relevant": "research", "irrelevant": END}
        )
        
        workflow.add_edge("research", "verify")
        
        workflow.add_conditional_edges(
            "verify",
            self._decide_next_step,
            {"re_research": "research", "end": END}
        )
        
        return workflow.compile()
```
