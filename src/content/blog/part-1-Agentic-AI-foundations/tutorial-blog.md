```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "server": "cu-glab-mcp"
}
```

---

## 🔧 Step 2: GitLab Setup

### Install glab CLI
```bash
# macOS
brew install glab

# Linux
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/profclems/glab/releases/latest | grep "browser_download_url.*linux_amd64.tar.gz" | cut -d '"' -f 4 | wget -qi - && tar -xzf glab_*_linux_amd64.tar.gz && sudo mv bin/glab /usr/local/bin/

# Windows
winget install profclems.glab
```

### Authenticate with GitLab
```bash
# Login to GitLab
glab auth login

# Choose your GitLab instance
? What GitLab instance do you want to log into? 
  ▸ gitlab.com
    self-hosted GitLab instance

# Follow the authentication flow
? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations? 
  ▸ HTTPS
    SSH

# Verify authentication
glab auth status
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Logged in to gitlab.com as your-username
✓ Git operations will be performed as your-username
✓ Token: ********************
```

---

## 🎮 Step 3: CLI Mode Usage

The `cu-glab-mcp` tool can be used directly from the command line for quick operations.

### List Issues
```bash
# List open issues
cu-glab-mcp issue list --project abudhahir/cleveloper-utilities

# List closed issues
cu-glab-mcp issue list --project abudhahir/cleveloper-utilities --state closed
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
[
  {
    "iid": 1,
    "title": "glab MCP not detecting existing issues",
    "state": "opened",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
]
```

### Create an Issue
```bash
# Create a new issue
cu-glab-mcp issue create \
  --project abudhahir/cleveloper-utilities \
  --title "Test Issue from MCP" \
  --description "This issue was created using the cu-glab-mcp tool"
```

### Manage Merge Requests
```bash
# Get merge request details
cu-glab-mcp mr get --project abudhahir/cleveloper-utilities --iid 1

# Get merge request changes
cu-glab-mcp mr changes --project abudhahir/cleveloper-utilities --iid 1

# Add comment to merge request
cu-glab-mcp mr comment \
  --project abudhahir/cleveloper-utilities \
  --iid 1 \
  --body "Great work on this implementation!"
```

---

## 🤖 Step 4: MCP Server Mode

The MCP server mode allows AI assistants to interact with GitLab through the Model Context Protocol.

```bash
# Start server in stdio mode (for AI assistants)
cu-glab-mcp
```

### Start MCP Server (SSE)
```bash
# Start server with Server-Sent Events
cu-glab-mcp --transport sse --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8765
```

### Start MCP Server (HTTP)
```bash
# Start server with HTTP transport
cu-glab-mcp --transport streamable_http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8765
```

---

## 🔌 Step 5: AI Assistant Integration

### Claude Desktop Configuration
Add to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cu-glab-mcp": {
      "command": "cu-glab-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "GITLAB_TOKEN": "your-gitlab-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Available MCP Tools
Once connected, your AI assistant will have access to these tools:

#### Issue Management
- `issue_list(project, state)` - List issues
- `issue_create(project, title, description)` - Create issues

#### Merge Request Management
- `mr_get(project, iid)` - Get MR details
- `mr_changes(project, iid)` - Get MR changes
- `mr_notes(project, iid)` - Get MR comments
- `mr_comment(project, iid, body)` - Add MR comment

### Example AI Assistant Usage
```
User: "Show me all open issues in the cleveloper-utilities project"

AI Assistant: I'll check the open issues for you.

[Uses issue_list tool]

Here are the open issues in abudhahir/cleveloper-utilities:
1. Issue #1: "glab MCP not detecting existing issues" (opened)
2. Issue #2: "Add comprehensive documentation" (opened)
```

---

## 🧪 Step 6: Testing and Verification

### Test Basic Functionality
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/health

# Test issue listing
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/tools/issue_list \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project": "abudhahir/cleveloper-utilities", "state": "opened"}'
```

### Verify MCP Tools
```python
# Test Python integration
import subprocess
import json

# Test issue listing
result = subprocess.run([
    "cu-glab-mcp", "issue", "list", 
    "--project", "abudhahir/cleveloper-utilities"
], capture_output=True, text=True)

issues = json.loads(result.stdout)
print(f"Found {len(issues)} issues")
```

# Problem: "connection timeout"
# Solution: Check network and GitLab instance
glab api /version
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose logging
export GLAB_DEBUG=1
cu-glab-mcp issue list --project your-project
```

---

## 📊 Step 8: Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration
Create a configuration file for repeated use:

```yaml
# .cu-glab-mcp.yml
default_project: "abudhahir/cleveloper-utilities"
default_state: "opened"
server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8765
  transport: "sse"
```

### Automation Scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# daily-issue-report.sh

PROJECT="abudhahir/cleveloper-utilities"
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

echo "Daily Issue Report - $DATE"
echo "=========================="

# Get open issues
cu-glab-mcp issue list --project $PROJECT --state opened > open_issues.json

# Get closed issues from today
cu-glab-mcp issue list --project $PROJECT --state closed > closed_issues.json

echo "Report generated successfully!"
```

### Integration with CI/CD
```yaml
# .github/workflows/gitlab-sync.yml
name: GitLab Sync
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * *'  # Daily at 9 AM

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install cu-glab-mcp
        run: |
          pip install cu-glab-mcp
      - name: Sync issues
        run: |
          cu-glab-mcp issue list --project ${{ github.repository }}
        env:
          GITLAB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITLAB_TOKEN }}
```

---

## 🎯 Step 9: Best Practices

### Security
- **Never commit tokens** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
- **Rotate tokens** regularly
- **Use minimal required permissions**

### Performance
- **Cache results** when possible
- **Use pagination** for large datasets
- **Monitor rate limits**
- **Implement retry logic**

### Error Handling
```python
import subprocess
import json
import time

def safe_glab_command(args, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            result = subprocess.run(
                ["cu-glab-mcp"] + args,
                capture_output=True,
                text=True,
                timeout=30
            )
            if result.returncode == 0:
                return json.loads(result.stdout)
        except (subprocess.TimeoutExpired, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise e
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
    return None
```

---

## 📈 Step 10: Monitoring and Analytics

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Create a health check script
#!/bin/bash
# health-check.sh

if cu-glab-mcp --health > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "✅ cu-glab-mcp is healthy"
    exit 0
else
    echo "❌ cu-glab-mcp is not responding"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Usage Analytics
```python
# analytics.py
import json
import time
from datetime import datetime

class GlabMCAAnalytics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.usage_log = []
    
    def log_operation(self, operation, project, success=True):
        self.usage_log.append({
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "operation": operation,
            "project": project,
            "success": success
        })
    
    def get_stats(self):
        total_ops = len(self.usage_log)
        successful_ops = sum(1 for log in self.usage_log if log["success"])
        return {
            "total_operations": total_ops,
            "success_rate": successful_ops / total_ops if total_ops > 0 else 0,
            "operations_by_type": self._group_by_operation()
        }
    
    def _group_by_operation(self):
        ops = {}
        for log in self.usage_log:
            op = log["operation"]
            ops[op] = ops.get(op, 0) + 1
        return ops
```
