# Experience Section Update Guide

This guide will help you update your Experience section with your real work history from LinkedIn.

## How to Update

1. Open the file: `src/components/Experience.jsx`
2. Find the `experiences` array at the top
3. Replace the placeholder content with your actual experience

## Template Structure

Each experience object should follow this format:

```javascript
{
  id: 1, // Unique number for each experience
  title: 'Your Job Title',
  company: 'Company Name',
  location: 'City, Country', // e.g., 'Olten, Switzerland'
  period: 'Start Year - End Year', // e.g., '2020 - Present'
  description: 'A 2-3 sentence description of your role and responsibilities.',
  achievements: [
    'Achievement 1 - Include metrics where possible',
    'Achievement 2 - Highlight technical accomplishments',
    'Achievement 3 - Show business impact',
  ],
  tech: ['Technology 1', 'Technology 2', 'Technology 3'], // List key technologies used
}
```

## Example with Real Data

Based on your GitHub projects, here's an example of how you might structure an experience:

```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  title: 'Senior Software Engineer',
  company: 'Your Company',
  location: 'Olten, Switzerland',
  period: '2021 - Present',
  description: 'Leading enterprise Java development and AI integration initiatives. Architecting microservices solutions and implementing OpenAI-powered tools for enhanced developer productivity.',
  achievements: [
    'Developed Merdit, an AI-powered Mermaid diagram generator using Azure OpenAI',
    'Architected and implemented Spring Boot microservices handling 10K+ requests/day',
    'Reduced code analysis time by 70% through custom AST parser development',
  ],
  tech: ['Java', 'Spring Boot', 'Azure OpenAI', 'Docker', 'Kubernetes', 'Python'],
}
```
